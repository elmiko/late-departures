# Late Departures

This repository contains a few applications for creating a demonstration of
stream processing flight departure information using Apache Kafka, Apache
Spark, and OpenShift.

## Prerequisites

To run this demonstration you will need an OpenShift project and an instance
of Apache Kafka deployed in that project. If you not familiar with OpenShift,
please see the
[getting started section](https://docs.openshift.org/latest/getting_started/index.html)
of their documentation. To deploy Kafka in your OpenShift project please see
the [Strimzi project](http://strimzi.io/) as an excellent resource for
deployment options.
